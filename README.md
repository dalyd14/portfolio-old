# Welcome To My Portfolio
[Link to my Portfolio](https://dalyd14.github.io/)

## Purpose
I would like to showcase everything that pertains to me and my goal to become a professional full-stack developer

## Known Bugs
* When using the id in-page navigation, the page doesn't navigate precisely due to the sticky header. I added an offset span so it would stop traveling at the correct location. However, since the header height always changes I do not know the exact pixel number to pffset by. I am sure javascript will be able to help.
* There were several empty tiles for my bootcamp projects. I wanted to showcase my css grid learnings while also not leading the viewer to think I have completed more projects than I actually have. Throughout the course, I will add to the tiles.
* The last personal project tile "Slowpoke App Project" currently just links to my GitHub account. I have yet to transfer my personal code to its own repository on my GitHub site.
* The two other personal project tiles simply link to the domains that I have for those projects. They do not currently have any content and they display a placeholder index.html page.

## Development Assignment
* For the second weekly assignment for the bootcamp that I am taking, we were assigned to take the lessons we have learned and apply them to our portfolio.
* The idea is to showcase my current CSS skills while also creating a basis in which to elaborate on as the bootcamp progresses

  ### Weekly Assignment-02
  * For my portfolio I have decided to develop using a mobile-first approach.
  * I will also create and utilize a develop branch so that I can make changes that will not disturb the published version
  * Towards the beginning of this assignment, I figured a good practice would be to create branches from the develop branch that represent each assignment we have for the portfolio
  * We were given a mock-up but very little design direction, so I will try to convey my own style while also fulfilling the limitted requirements
