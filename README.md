# Welcome To My Portfolio
[Link to my Portfolio](https://dalyd14.github.io/)

## Purpose
I would like to showcase everything that pertains to me and my goal to become a professional full-stack developer

## Development Assignment
* For the second weekly assignment for the bootcamp that I am taking, we were assigned to take the lessons we have learned and apply them to our portfolio.
* The idea is to showcase my current CSS skills while also creating a basis in which to elaborate on as the bootcamp progresses

  ### Weekly Assignment-02
  * For my portfolio I have decided to develop using a mobile-first approach.
  * I will also create and utilize a develop branch so that I can make changes that will not disturb the published version
  * Towards the beginning of this assignment, I figured a good practice would be to create branches from the develop branch that represent each assignment we have for the portfolio
  * We were given a mock-up but very little design direction, so I will try to convey my own style and to showcase employers what I am capable of
